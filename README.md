# Social Climbing

Welcome to my page Social Climbing. This is a website that gives climbers a way to socialise and plan events together.
This is my 4:th project for my portfolio through Code Institutes course Fullstack Developer. [Read more](http://codeinstitute.com)

On Social climbing you can view all upcoming events and if you register as a user you can log in and create your own events. While logged in you can also attend others events and comment on them.

# User experience UX

## User Stories
 - As a Administrator I can create events so that I can get people together for planning an event
 - As a user I can pick my own image for my event so that I can reach out with a unique event post
 - As a User I can receive messages telling me I submitted successfully so that be sure that my action was successfull
 - As a Administrator I can update and delete events so that I can provide new information if something changes
 - As a User I can see only events that are in the future so that I can focus on the events that are relevent
